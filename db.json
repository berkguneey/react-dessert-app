      "description": "A mousse is always a great dessert option, thanks to its texture and its simplicity. Especially now that artisanal food and authentic flavors are in vogue. Offer a mixed berry version of this creamy dessert for a delicious combination of sweet and tart. This is the perfect light option to offer clients after a hearty meal."

      "description": "Continuing with the theme of fruits and creamy textures, here's an option using more exotic fruits. We suggest adding a classic French soufflé to your menu, and taking it to the next level with mango morsels and a coconut topping. These two fruits are very appealing to clients, thanks to their natural sweetness, delicate flavors, and distinctive textures, since mango is soft and coconut is both crunchier and creamier. Go ahead and surprise your clients with this dessert!"

      "description": "Carrot cake is one of the most popular cakes around these days. This home-style cake has been re-invented with a thick, sweet frosting made from cream cheese and nuts, and the use of whole cane sugar. Clients definitely prefer this cake when it highlights all the natural sweetness of the carrots, so that they can treat themselves without forsaking health entirely. Include it in your menu and add a personal touch, like a gluten-free version for patients with Celiac's disease."

      "description": "We're pleased to introduce you to another popular dessert. Her name is Blondie! Actually, it's a brownie with less chocolate and more whole cane sugar, making it more blonde than the traditional version. It also has a much airier texture than the dense chocolate brownie, so it pairs well with a touch of liquor, like rum, or with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for contrasting sensations."
